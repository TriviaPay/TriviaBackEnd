    1: """Connection pooling for DB-API connections.
       
       Provides a number of connection pool implementations for a variety of
       usage scenarios and thread behavior requirements imposed by the
       application, DB-API or database itself.
       
       Also provides a DB-API 2.0 connection proxying mechanism allowing
       regular DB-API connect() methods to be transparently managed by a
       SQLAlchemy connection pool.
