    1: """SQL connections, SQL execution and high-level DB-API interface.
       
       The engine package defines the basic components used to interface
       DB-API modules with higher-level statement construction,
       connection-management, execution and result contexts.  The primary
       "entry point" class into this package is the Engine and its public
       constructor ``create_engine()``.
