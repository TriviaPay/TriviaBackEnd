       HTML parsing library based on the `WHATWG HTML specification
       <https://whatwg.org/html>`_. The parser is designed to be compatible with
       existing HTML found in the wild and implements well-defined error recovery that
       is largely compatible with modern desktop web browsers.
       
       Example usage::
       
           import html5lib
           with open("my_document.html", "rb") as f:
               tree = html5lib.parse(f)
       
       For convenience, this module re-exports the following names:
       
       * :func:`~.html5parser.parse`
       * :func:`~.html5parser.parseFragment`
       * :class:`~.html5parser.HTMLParser`
       * :func:`~.treebuilders.getTreeBuilder`
       * :func:`~.treewalkers.getTreeWalker`
       * :func:`~.serializer.serialize`
