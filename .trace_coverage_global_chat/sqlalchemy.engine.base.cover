               This method modifies this :class:`_engine.Connection` **in-place**;
               the return value is the same :class:`_engine.Connection` object
               upon which the method is called.   Note that this is in contrast
               to the behavior of the ``execution_options`` methods on other
               objects such as :meth:`_engine.Engine.execution_options` and
               :meth:`_sql.Executable.execution_options`.  The rationale is that many
               such execution options necessarily modify the state of the base
               DBAPI connection in any case so there is no feasible means of
               keeping the effect of such an option localized to a "sub" connection.
       
               .. versionchanged:: 2.0  The :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`
                  method, in contrast to other objects with this method, modifies
                  the connection in-place without creating copy of it.
       
               As discussed elsewhere, the :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`
               method accepts any arbitrary parameters including user defined names.
               All parameters given are consumable in a number of ways including
               by using the :meth:`_engine.Connection.get_execution_options` method.
               See the examples at :meth:`_sql.Executable.execution_options`
               and :meth:`_engine.Engine.execution_options`.
       
               The keywords that are currently recognized by SQLAlchemy itself
               include all those listed under :meth:`.Executable.execution_options`,
               as well as others that are specific to :class:`_engine.Connection`.
       
               :param compiled_cache: Available on: :class:`_engine.Connection`,
                 :class:`_engine.Engine`.
       
                 A dictionary where :class:`.Compiled` objects
                 will be cached when the :class:`_engine.Connection`
                 compiles a clause
                 expression into a :class:`.Compiled` object.  This dictionary will
                 supersede the statement cache that may be configured on the
                 :class:`_engine.Engine` itself.   If set to None, caching
                 is disabled, even if the engine has a configured cache size.
       
                 Note that the ORM makes use of its own "compiled" caches for
                 some operations, including flush operations.  The caching
                 used by the ORM internally supersedes a cache dictionary
                 specified here.

                 Adds the specified string token surrounded by brackets in log
                 messages logged by the connection, i.e. the logging that's enabled
                 either via the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.echo` flag or via the
                 ``logging.getLogger("sqlalchemy.engine")`` logger. This allows a
                 per-connection or per-sub-engine token to be available which is
                 useful for debugging concurrent connection scenarios.

                 Set the transaction isolation level for the lifespan of this
                 :class:`_engine.Connection` object.
                 Valid values include those string
                 values accepted by the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level`
                 parameter passed to :func:`_sa.create_engine`.  These levels are
                 semi-database specific; see individual dialect documentation for
                 valid levels.
       
                 The isolation level option applies the isolation level by emitting
                 statements on the DBAPI connection, and **necessarily affects the
                 original Connection object overall**. The isolation level will remain
                 at the given setting until explicitly changed, or when the DBAPI
                 connection itself is :term:`released` to the connection pool, i.e. the
                 :meth:`_engine.Connection.close` method is called, at which time an
                 event handler will emit additional statements on the DBAPI connection
                 in order to revert the isolation level change.
       
                 .. note:: The ``isolation_level`` execution option may only be
                    established before the :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin` method is
                    called, as well as before any SQL statements are emitted which
                    would otherwise trigger "autobegin", or directly after a call to
                    :meth:`_engine.Connection.commit` or
                    :meth:`_engine.Connection.rollback`. A database cannot change the
                    isolation level on a transaction in progress.
       
                 .. note:: The ``isolation_level`` execution option is implicitly
                    reset if the :class:`_engine.Connection` is invalidated, e.g. via
                    the :meth:`_engine.Connection.invalidate` method, or if a
                    disconnection error occurs. The new connection produced after the
                    invalidation will **not** have the selected isolation level
                    re-applied to it automatically.

                 When ``True``, if the final parameter
                 list or dictionary is totally empty, will invoke the
                 statement on the cursor as ``cursor.execute(statement)``,
                 not passing the parameter collection at all.
                 Some DBAPIs such as psycopg2 and mysql-python consider
                 percent signs as significant only when parameters are
                 present; this option allows code to generate SQL
                 containing percent signs (and possibly other characters)
                 that is neutral regarding whether it's executed by the DBAPI
                 or piped into a script that's later invoked by
                 command line tools.
       
               :param stream_results: Available on: :class:`_engine.Connection`,
                 :class:`_sql.Executable`.
       
                 Indicate to the dialect that results should be
                 "streamed" and not pre-buffered, if possible.  For backends
                 such as PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB, this indicates the use of
                 a "server side cursor" as opposed to a client side cursor.
                 Other backends such as that of Oracle may already use server
                 side cursors by default.
       
                 The usage of
                 :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.stream_results` is
                 usually combined with setting a fixed number of rows to to be fetched
                 in batches, to allow for efficient iteration of database rows while
                 at the same time not loading all result rows into memory at once;
                 this can be configured on a :class:`_engine.Result` object using the
                 :meth:`_engine.Result.yield_per` method, after execution has
                 returned a new :class:`_engine.Result`.   If
                 :meth:`_engine.Result.yield_per` is not used,
                 the :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.stream_results`
                 mode of operation will instead use a dynamically sized buffer
                 which buffers sets of rows at a time, growing on each batch
                 based on a fixed growth size up until a limit which may
                 be configured using the
                 :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.max_row_buffer`
                 parameter.
       
                 When using the ORM to fetch ORM mapped objects from a result,
                 :meth:`_engine.Result.yield_per` should always be used with
                 :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.stream_results`,
                 so that the ORM does not fetch all rows into new ORM objects at once.
       
                 For typical use, the
                 :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.yield_per` execution
                 option should be preferred, which sets up both
                 :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.stream_results` and
                 :meth:`_engine.Result.yield_per` at once. This option is supported
                 both at a core level by :class:`_engine.Connection` as well as by the
                 ORM :class:`_engine.Session`; the latter is described at
                 :ref:`orm_queryguide_yield_per`.

               The :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin` method begins a
               transaction that normally will be begun in any case when the connection
               is first used to execute a statement.  The reason this method might be
               used would be to invoke the :meth:`_events.ConnectionEvents.begin`
               event at a specific time, or to organize code within the scope of a
               connection checkout in terms of context managed blocks, such as::

                           conn.execute(...)
       
               The above code is not  fundamentally any different in its behavior than
               the following code  which does not use
               :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin`; the below style is known
               as "commit as you go" style::

                       conn.commit()
       
               From a database point of view, the :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin`
               method does not emit any SQL or change the state of the underlying
               DBAPI connection in any way; the Python DBAPI does not have any

               these methods correspond to the operations "RELEASE SAVEPOINT <name>"

               illustrated above which will "release" or "rollback" corresponding to

               Nested transactions require SAVEPOINT support in the underlying

                       with connection.begin_nested(): will auto-"begin()" first

           :class:`_engine.Connection`.
       
           When using :class:`.NestedTransaction`, the semantics of "begin" /

           * The :meth:`.NestedTransaction.commit` method corresponds to a
             "RELEASE SAVEPOINT" operation, using the savepoint identifier associated

               The returned :class:`_engine.Engine` remains related to the original
               :class:`_engine.Engine` in that it shares the same connection pool and
               other state:
       
               * The :class:`_pool.Pool` used by the new :class:`_engine.Engine`
                 is the

                 the connection pool instance for the parent engine as well
                 as this one.
               * Event listeners are "cascaded" - meaning, the new
                 :class:`_engine.Engine`
                 inherits the events of the parent, and new events can be associated
                 with the new :class:`_engine.Engine` individually.
               * The logging configuration and logging_name is copied from the parent
                 :class:`_engine.Engine`.
       
               The intent of the :meth:`_engine.Engine.execution_options` method is
               to implement schemes where multiple :class:`_engine.Engine`
               objects refer to the same connection pool, but are differentiated
               by options that affect some execution-level behavior for each
               engine.    One such example is breaking into separate "reader" and
               "writer" :class:`_engine.Engine` instances, where one
               :class:`_engine.Engine`
               has a lower :term:`isolation level` setting configured or is even
               transaction-disabled using "autocommit".  An example of this
               configuration is at :ref:`dbapi_autocommit_multiple`.
       
               Another example is one that
               uses a custom option ``shard_id`` which is consumed by an event
               to change the current schema on a database connection::
       
                   from sqlalchemy import event
                   from sqlalchemy.engine import Engine
       
                   primary_engine = create_engine("mysql+mysqldb://")
                   shard1 = primary_engine.execution_options(shard_id="shard1")
                   shard2 = primary_engine.execution_options(shard_id="shard2")
       
                   shards = {"default": "base", "shard_1": "db1", "shard_2": "db2"}
       
                   @event.listens_for(Engine, "before_cursor_execute")
                   def _switch_shard(conn, cursor, stmt,
                           params, context, executemany):
                       shard_id = conn.get_execution_options().get('shard_id', "default")
                       current_shard = conn.info.get("current_shard", None)
       
                       if current_shard != shard_id:
                           cursor.execute("use %s" % shards[shard_id])
                           conn.info["current_shard"] = shard_id
       
               The above recipe illustrates two :class:`_engine.Engine` objects that
               will each serve as factories for :class:`_engine.Connection` objects
               that have pre-established "shard_id" execution options present. A
               :meth:`_events.ConnectionEvents.before_cursor_execute` event handler
               then interprets this execution option to emit a MySQL ``use`` statement
               to switch databases before a statement execution, while at the same
               time keeping track of which database we've established using the
