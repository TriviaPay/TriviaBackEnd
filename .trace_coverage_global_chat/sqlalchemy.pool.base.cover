                 connection object.  The function will be called with
                 parameters.
       
               :param recycle: If set to a value other than -1, number of
                 seconds between connection recycling, which means upon
                 checkout, if this timeout is surpassed the connection will be
                 closed and replaced with a newly opened connection. Defaults to -1.

                 the "name" field of logging records generated within the

                as well as when connections are recycled to the default log handler,
                which defaults to ``sys.stdout`` for output..   If set to the string
                ``"debug"``, the logging will include pool checkouts and checkins.
       
                The :paramref:`_pool.Pool.echo` parameter can also be set from the
                :func:`_sa.create_engine` call by using the
                :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.echo_pool` parameter.
       
                .. seealso::
       
                    :ref:`dbengine_logging` - further detail on how to configure
                    logging.
       
               :param reset_on_return: Determine steps to take on
                connections as they are returned to the pool, which were
                not otherwise handled by a :class:`_engine.Connection`.
                Available from :func:`_sa.create_engine` via the
                :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.pool_reset_on_return` parameter.
       
                :paramref:`_pool.Pool.reset_on_return` can have any of these values:
       
                * ``"rollback"`` - call rollback() on the connection,
                  to release locks and transaction resources.
                  This is the default value.  The vast majority
                  of use cases should leave this value set.
                * ``"commit"`` - call commit() on the connection,
                  to release locks and transaction resources.
                  A commit here may be desirable for databases that
                  cache query plans if a commit is emitted,
                  such as Microsoft SQL Server.  However, this
                  value is more dangerous than 'rollback' because
                  any data changes present on the transaction
                  are committed unconditionally.
                * ``None`` - don't do anything on the connection.
                  This setting may be appropriate if the database / DBAPI
                  works in pure "autocommit" mode at all times, or if
                  a custom reset handler is established using the
                  :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event handler.
       
                * ``True`` - same as 'rollback', this is here for
                  backwards compatibility.
                * ``False`` - same as None, this is here for
                  backwards compatibility.
       
                For further customization of reset on return, the
                :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset` event hook may be used which can perform
                any connection activity desired on reset.
       
                .. seealso::
       
                   :ref:`pool_reset_on_return`
       
                   :meth:`.PoolEvents.reset`
       
               :param events: a list of 2-tuples, each of the form
                ``(callable, target)`` which will be passed to :func:`.event.listen`
                upon construction.   Provided here so that event listeners
                can be assigned via :func:`_sa.create_engine` before dialect-level
                listeners are applied.
       
               :param dialect: a :class:`.Dialect` that will handle the job
                of calling rollback(), close(), or commit() on DBAPI connections.
                If omitted, a built-in "stub" dialect is used.   Applications that
                make use of :func:`_sa.create_engine` should not use this parameter
                as it is handled by the engine creation strategy.
       
               :param pre_ping: if True, the pool will emit a "ping" (typically
                "SELECT 1", but is dialect-specific) on the connection
                upon checkout, to test if the connection is alive or not.   If not,
                the connection is transparently re-connected and upon success, all
                other pooled connections established prior to that timestamp are
                invalidated.     Requires that a dialect is passed as well to
                interpret the disconnection error.
