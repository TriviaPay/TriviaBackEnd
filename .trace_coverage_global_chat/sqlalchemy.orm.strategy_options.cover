               The option is used in conjunction with an explicit join that loads
               the desired rows, i.e.::
       
                   sess.query(Order).\
                           join(Order.user).\
                           options(contains_eager(Order.user))
       
               The above query would join from the ``Order`` entity to its related
               ``User`` entity, and the returned ``Order`` objects would have the
               ``Order.user`` attribute pre-populated.
       
               It may also be used for customizing the entries in an eagerly loaded
               collection; queries will normally want to use the
               :ref:`orm_queryguide_populate_existing` execution option assuming the
               primary collection of parent objects may already have been loaded::

               :param innerjoin: if ``True``, indicates that the joined eager load
                should use an inner join instead of the default of left outer join::
       
                   query(Order).options(joinedload(Order.user, innerjoin=True))
       
               In order to chain multiple eager joins together where some may be
               OUTER and others INNER, right-nested joins are used to link them::
       
                   query(A).options(
                       joinedload(A.bs, innerjoin=False).
                           joinedload(B.cs, innerjoin=True)
                   )
       
               The above query, linking A.bs via "outer" join and B.cs via "inner"
               join would render the joins as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN (b JOIN c)". When
               using older versions of SQLite (< 3.7.16), this form of JOIN is
               translated to use full subqueries as this syntax is otherwise not
               directly supported.
       
               The ``innerjoin`` flag can also be stated with the term ``"unnested"``.
               This indicates that an INNER JOIN should be used, *unless* the join
               is linked to a LEFT OUTER JOIN to the left, in which case it
               will render as LEFT OUTER JOIN.  For example, supposing ``A.bs``
               is an outerjoin::
       
                   query(A).options(
                       joinedload(A.bs).
                           joinedload(B.cs, innerjoin="unnested")
                   )
       
               The above join will render as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN b LEFT OUTER JOIN c",
               rather than as "a LEFT OUTER JOIN (b JOIN c)".
       
               .. note:: The "unnested" flag does **not** affect the JOIN rendered
                   from a many-to-many association table, e.g. a table configured as
                   :paramref:`_orm.relationship.secondary`, to the target table; for
                   correctness of results, these joins are always INNER and are
                   therefore right-nested if linked to an OUTER join.
       
               .. note::
       
                   The joins produced by :func:`_orm.joinedload` are **anonymously
                   aliased**. The criteria by which the join proceeds cannot be
                   modified, nor can the ORM-enabled :class:`_sql.Select` or legacy
                   :class:`_query.Query` refer to these joins in any way, including
                   ordering. See :ref:`zen_of_eager_loading` for further detail.
       
                   To produce a specific SQL JOIN which is explicitly available, use
                   :meth:`_sql.Select.join` and :meth:`_query.Query.join`. To combine
                   explicit JOINs with eager loading of collections, use
