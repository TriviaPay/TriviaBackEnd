           """Create a new :class:`_engine.Engine` instance.
       
           The standard calling form is to send the :ref:`URL <database_urls>` as the
           first positional argument, usually a string
           that indicates database dialect and connection arguments::
       
               engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://scott:tiger@localhost/test")
       
           .. note::
       
               Please review :ref:`database_urls` for general guidelines in composing
               URL strings.  In particular, special characters, such as those often
               part of passwords, must be URL encoded to be properly parsed.
       
           Additional keyword arguments may then follow it which
           establish various options on the resulting :class:`_engine.Engine`
           and its underlying :class:`.Dialect` and :class:`_pool.Pool`
           constructs::
       
               engine = create_engine("mysql+mysqldb://scott:tiger@hostname/dbname",
                                           pool_recycle=3600, echo=True)
       
           The string form of the URL is
           ``dialect[+driver]://user:password@host/dbname[?key=value..]``, where
           ``dialect`` is a database name such as ``mysql``, ``oracle``,
           ``postgresql``, etc., and ``driver`` the name of a DBAPI, such as
           ``psycopg2``, ``pyodbc``, ``cx_oracle``, etc.  Alternatively,
           the URL can be an instance of :class:`~sqlalchemy.engine.url.URL`.
       
           ``**kwargs`` takes a wide variety of options which are routed
           towards their appropriate components.  Arguments may be specific to
           the :class:`_engine.Engine`, the underlying :class:`.Dialect`,
           as well as the
           :class:`_pool.Pool`.  Specific dialects also accept keyword arguments that
           are unique to that dialect.   Here, we describe the parameters
           that are common to most :func:`_sa.create_engine()` usage.
       
           Once established, the newly resulting :class:`_engine.Engine` will
           request a connection from the underlying :class:`_pool.Pool` once
           :meth:`_engine.Engine.connect` is called, or a method which depends on it
           such as :meth:`_engine.Engine.execute` is invoked.   The
           :class:`_pool.Pool` in turn
           will establish the first actual DBAPI connection when this request
           is received.   The :func:`_sa.create_engine` call itself does **not**
           establish any actual DBAPI connections directly.

               :ref:`connections_toplevel`
       
           :param connect_args: a dictionary of options which will be
               passed directly to the DBAPI's ``connect()`` method as
               additional keyword arguments.  See the example
               at :ref:`custom_dbapi_args`.
       
           :param creator: a callable which returns a DBAPI connection.
               This creation function will be passed to the underlying
               connection pool and will be used to create all new database
               connections. Usage of this function causes connection
               parameters specified in the URL argument to be bypassed.
       
               This hook is not as flexible as the newer
               :meth:`_events.DialectEvents.do_connect` hook which allows complete
               control over how a connection is made to the database, given the full
               set of URL arguments and state beforehand.

                   :ref:`custom_dbapi_args`
       
           :param echo=False: if True, the Engine will log all statements
               as well as a ``repr()`` of their parameter lists to the default log
               handler, which defaults to ``sys.stdout`` for output.   If set to the
               string ``"debug"``, result rows will be printed to the standard output
               as well. The ``echo`` attribute of ``Engine`` can be modified at any
               time to turn logging on and off; direct control of logging is also
               available using the standard Python ``logging`` module.

                   logging.
       
       
           :param echo_pool=False: if True, the connection pool will log
               informational output such as when connections are invalidated
               as well as when connections are recycled to the default log handler,
               which defaults to ``sys.stdout`` for output.   If set to the string
               ``"debug"``, the logging will include pool checkouts and checkins.
               Direct control of logging is also available using the standard Python
               ``logging`` module.

           :param empty_in_strategy:   No longer used; SQLAlchemy now uses
               "empty set" behavior for IN in all cases.
       
           :param enable_from_linting: defaults to True.  Will emit a warning
               if a given SELECT statement is found to have un-linked FROM elements
               which would cause a cartesian product.

               :meth:`~sqlalchemy.engine.Connection.execution_options`
       
           :param future: Use the 2.0 style :class:`_engine.Engine` and
               :class:`_engine.Connection` API.
       
               As of SQLAlchemy 2.0, this parameter is present for backwards
               compatibility only and must remain at its default value of ``True``.
       
               The :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.future` parameter will be
               deprecated in a subsequent 2.x release and eventually removed.
       
               .. versionadded:: 1.4
       
               .. versionchanged:: 2.0 All :class:`_engine.Engine` objects are
                  "future" style engines and there is no longer a ``future=False``
                  mode of operation.

           :param hide_parameters: Boolean, when set to True, SQL statement parameters
               will not be displayed in INFO logging nor will they be formatted into
               the string representation of :class:`.StatementError` objects.

                   logging.
       
           :param implicit_returning=True:  Legacy parameter that may only be set
               to True. In SQLAlchemy 2.0, this parameter does nothing. In order to
               disable "implicit returning" for statements invoked by the ORM,
               configure this on a per-table basis using the
               :paramref:`.Table.implicit_returning` parameter.
       
       
           :param insertmanyvalues_page_size: number of rows to format into an
            INSERT statement when the statement uses "insertmanyvalues" mode, which is
            a paged form of bulk insert that is used for many backends when using
            :term:`executemany` execution typically in conjunction with RETURNING.
            Defaults to 1000, but may also be subject to dialect-specific limiting
            factors which may override this value on a per-statement basis.

               :paramref:`_engine.Connection.execution_options.insertmanyvalues_page_size`
       
           :param isolation_level: optional string name of an isolation level
               which will be set on all new connections unconditionally.
               Isolation levels are typically some subset of the string names
               ``"SERIALIZABLE"``, ``"REPEATABLE READ"``,
               ``"READ COMMITTED"``, ``"READ UNCOMMITTED"`` and ``"AUTOCOMMIT"``
               based on backend.
       
               The :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level` parameter is
               in contrast to the
               :paramref:`.Connection.execution_options.isolation_level`
               execution option, which may be set on an individual
               :class:`.Connection`, as well as the same parameter passed to
               :meth:`.Engine.execution_options`, where it may be used to create
               multiple engines with different isolation levels that share a common
               connection pool and dialect.
       
               .. versionchanged:: 2.0 The
                  :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level`
                  parameter has been generalized to work on all dialects which support
                  the concept of isolation level, and is provided as a more succinct,
                  up front configuration switch in contrast to the execution option
                  which is more of an ad-hoc programmatic option.

               datatype, this is a Python callable that will convert a JSON string
               to a Python object.  By default, the Python ``json.loads`` function is
               used.
       
               .. versionchanged:: 1.3.7  The SQLite dialect renamed this from

           :param label_length=None: optional integer value which limits
               the size of dynamically generated column labels to that many
               characters. If less than 6, labels are generated as
               "_(counter)". If ``None``, the value of
               ``dialect.max_identifier_length``, which may be affected via the
               :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.max_identifier_length` parameter,
               is used instead.   The value of
               :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.label_length`
               may not be larger than that of
               :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.max_identfier_length`.

               the "name" field of logging records generated within the

               is the database's configured maximum number of characters that may be
               used in a SQL identifier such as a table name, column name, or label
               name. All dialects determine this value automatically, however in the
               case of a new database version for which this value has changed but
               SQLAlchemy's dialect has not been adjusted, the value may be passed
               here.

               opened above and beyond the pool_size setting, which defaults
               to five. this is only used with :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool`.
       
           :param module=None: reference to a Python module object (the module
               itself, not its string name).  Specifies an alternate DBAPI module to
               be used by the engine's dialect.  Each sub-dialect references a
               specific DBAPI which will be imported before first connect.  This
               parameter causes the import to be bypassed, and the given module to
               be used instead. Can be used for testing of DBAPIs as well as to
               inject "mock" DBAPI implementations into the :class:`_engine.Engine`.
       
           :param paramstyle=None: The `paramstyle <https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#paramstyle>`_
               to use when rendering bound parameters.  This style defaults to the
               one recommended by the DBAPI itself, which is retrieved from the
               ``.paramstyle`` attribute of the DBAPI.  However, most DBAPIs accept
               more than one paramstyle, and in particular it may be desirable
               to change a "named" paramstyle into a "positional" one, or vice versa.
               When this attribute is passed, it should be one of the values
               ``"qmark"``, ``"numeric"``, ``"named"``, ``"format"`` or
               ``"pyformat"``, and should correspond to a parameter style known
               to be supported by the DBAPI in use.
       
           :param pool=None: an already-constructed instance of
               :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.Pool`, such as a
               :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool` instance. If non-None, this
               pool will be used directly as the underlying connection pool
               for the engine, bypassing whatever connection parameters are
               present in the URL argument. For information on constructing
               connection pools manually, see :ref:`pooling_toplevel`.
       
           :param poolclass=None: a :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.Pool`
               subclass, which will be used to create a connection pool
               instance using the connection parameters given in the URL. Note
               this differs from ``pool`` in that you don't actually
               instantiate the pool in this case, you just indicate what type
               of pool to be used.
       
           :param pool_logging_name:  String identifier which will be used within
              the "name" field of logging records generated within the
              "sqlalchemy.pool" logger. Defaults to a hexstring of the object's
              id.
       
              .. seealso::
       
                   :ref:`dbengine_logging` - further detail on how to configure
                   logging.
       
           :param pool_pre_ping: boolean, if True will enable the connection pool
               "pre-ping" feature that tests connections for liveness upon
               each checkout.

                   :ref:`pool_disconnects_pessimistic`
       
           :param pool_size=5: the number of connections to keep open
               inside the connection pool. This used with
               :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool` as
               well as :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.SingletonThreadPool`.  With
               :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool`, a ``pool_size`` setting
               of 0 indicates no limit; to disable pooling, set ``poolclass`` to
               :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.NullPool` instead.
       
           :param pool_recycle=-1: this setting causes the pool to recycle
               connections after the given number of seconds has passed. It
               defaults to -1, or no timeout. For example, setting to 3600
               means connections will be recycled after one hour. Note that
               MySQL in particular will disconnect automatically if no
               activity is detected on a connection for eight hours (although
               this is configurable with the MySQLDB connection itself and the
               server configuration as well).

                   :ref:`pool_setting_recycle`

               :paramref:`_pool.Pool.reset_on_return` parameter of the underlying
               :class:`_pool.Pool` object, which can be set to the values
               ``"rollback"``, ``"commit"``, or ``None``.

                   :ref:`pool_reset_on_return`
       
           :param pool_timeout=30: number of seconds to wait before giving
               up on getting a connection from the pool. This is only used
               with :class:`~sqlalchemy.pool.QueuePool`. This can be a float but is
               subject to the limitations of Python time functions which may not be
               reliable in the tens of milliseconds.
       
               .. note: don't use 30.0 above, it seems to break with the :param tag
       
           :param pool_use_lifo=False: use LIFO (last-in-first-out) when retrieving
               connections from :class:`.QueuePool` instead of FIFO
               (first-in-first-out). Using LIFO, a server-side timeout scheme can
               reduce the number of connections used during non- peak   periods of
               use.   When planning for server-side timeouts, ensure that a recycle or
               pre-ping strategy is in use to gracefully   handle stale connections.

               .. versionadded:: 1.2.3
       
           :param query_cache_size: size of the cache used to cache the SQL string
            form of queries.  Set to zero to disable caching.
       
            The cache is pruned of its least recently used items when its size reaches
            N * 1.5.  Defaults to 500, meaning the cache will always store at least
            500 SQL statements when filled, and will grow up to 750 items at which
            point it is pruned back down to 500 by removing the 250 least recently
            used items.
       
            Caching is accomplished on a per-statement basis by generating a
            cache key that represents the statement's structure, then generating
            string SQL for the current dialect only if that key is not present
            in the cache.   All statements support caching, however some features
            such as an INSERT with a large set of parameters will intentionally
            bypass the cache.   SQL logging will indicate statistics for each
            statement whether or not it were pull from the cache.
       
            .. note:: some ORM functions related to unit-of-work persistence as well
               as some attribute loading strategies will make use of individual
               per-mapper caches outside of the main cache.

           ``sqlalchemy.url``, ``sqlalchemy.echo``, etc.  The 'prefix' argument
