           This is a dependency class to collect the `username` and `password` as form data
           for an OAuth2 password flow.
       
           The OAuth2 specification dictates that for a password flow the data should be
           collected using form data (instead of JSON) and that it should have the specific
           fields `username` and `password`.
       
           All the initialization parameters are extracted from the request.
       
           Read more about it in the
           [FastAPI docs for Simple OAuth2 with Password and Bearer](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/simple-oauth2/).
       
           ## Example
       
           ```python
           from typing import Annotated
       
           from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
           from fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordRequestForm
       
           app = FastAPI()
       
       
           @app.post("/login")
           def login(form_data: Annotated[OAuth2PasswordRequestForm, Depends()]):
               data = {}
               data["scopes"] = []
               for scope in form_data.scopes:
                   data["scopes"].append(scope)
               if form_data.client_id:
                   data["client_id"] = form_data.client_id
               if form_data.client_secret:
                   data["client_secret"] = form_data.client_secret
               return data
           ```
       
           Note that for OAuth2 the scope `items:read` is a single scope in an opaque string.
           You could have custom internal logic to separate it by colon caracters (`:`) or
           similar, and get the two parts `items` and `read`. Many applications do that to
           group and organize permisions, you could do it as well in your application, just
           know that that it is application specific, it's not part of the specification.

           The only difference between `OAuth2PasswordRequestFormStrict` and
