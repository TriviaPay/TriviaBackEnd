    1: """Support for collections of mapped entities.
       
       The collections package supplies the machinery used to inform the ORM of
       collection membership changes.  An instrumentation via decoration approach is
       used, allowing arbitrary types (including built-ins) to be used as entity
       collections without requiring inheritance from a base class.
       
       Instrumentation decoration relays membership change events to the
       :class:`.CollectionAttributeImpl` that is currently managing the collection.
       The decorators observe function call arguments and return values, tracking
       entities entering or leaving the collection.  Two decorator approaches are
       provided.  One is a bundle of generic decorators that map function arguments
       and return values to events::
       
         from sqlalchemy.orm.collections import collection
         class MyClass:
             # ...
       
             @collection.adds(1)
             def store(self, item):
                 self.data.append(item)
       
             @collection.removes_return()
             def pop(self):
                 return self.data.pop()
       
       
       The second approach is a bundle of targeted decorators that wrap appropriate
       append and remove notifiers around the mutation methods present in the
       standard Python ``list``, ``set`` and ``dict`` interfaces.  These could be
       specified in terms of generic decorator recipes, but are instead hand-tooled
       for increased efficiency.  The targeted decorators occasionally implement
       adapter-like behavior, such as mapping bulk-set methods (``extend``,
       ``update``, ``__setslice__``, etc.) into the series of atomic mutation events
       that the ORM requires.
       
       The targeted decorators are used internally for automatic instrumentation of
       entity collection classes.  Every collection class goes through a
       transformation process roughly like so:
       
       1. If the class is a built-in, substitute a trivial sub-class
       2. Is this class already instrumented?
       3. Add in generic decorators
       4. Sniff out the collection interface through duck-typing
       5. Add targeted decoration to any undecorated interface method
       
       This process modifies the class at runtime, decorating methods and adding some
       bookkeeping properties.  This isn't possible (or desirable) for built-in
       classes like ``list``, so trivial sub-classes are substituted to hold
       decoration::
       
         class InstrumentedList(list):
             pass
       
       Collection classes can be specified in ``relationship(collection_class=)`` as
       types or a function that returns an instance.  Collection classes are
       inspected and instrumented during the mapper compilation phase.  The
       collection_class callable will be executed once to produce a specimen
       instance, and the type of that specimen will be instrumented.  Functions that
       return built-in types like ``lists`` will be adapted to produce instrumented
       instances.
       
       When extending a known type like ``list``, additional decorations are not
       generally not needed.  Odds are, the extension method will delegate to a
       method that's already instrumented.  For example::
       
         class QueueIsh(list):
            def push(self, item):
                self.append(item)
            def shift(self):
                return self.pop(0)
       
       There's no need to decorate these methods.  ``append`` and ``pop`` are already
       instrumented as part of the ``list`` interface.  Decorating them would fire
       duplicate events, which should be avoided.
       
       The targeted decoration tries not to rely on other methods in the underlying
       collection class, but some are unavoidable.  Many depend on 'read' methods
       being present to properly instrument a 'write', for example, ``__setitem__``
       needs ``__getitem__``.  "Bulk" methods like ``update`` and ``extend`` may also
       reimplemented in terms of atomic appends and removes, so the ``extend``
       decoration will actually perform many ``append`` operations and not call the
       underlying method at all.
       
       Tight control over bulk operation and the firing of events is also possible by
       implementing the instrumentation internally in your methods.  The basic
       instrumentation package works under the general assumption that collection
       mutation will not raise unusual exceptions.  If you want to closely
       orchestrate append and remove events with exception management, internal
       instrumentation may be the answer.  Within your method,
       ``collection_adapter(self)`` will retrieve an object that you can use for
       explicit control over triggering append and remove events.
       
       The owning object and :class:`.CollectionAttributeImpl` are also reachable
       through the adapter, allowing for some very sophisticated behavior.
